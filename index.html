                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                </p><p>
                    MCH Systems aspires to become the primary source for computer systems that are designed to perform mission critical applications while enduring the stresses of  severe environments.  Our current focus in on Mission Critical Electronic Warfare and Signal Intelligence applications.

                <h3>Company Profile</h3>
            </p><p>
            MCH Systems was founded in August of 2000 to become the leading supplier of rugged computer systems designed to operate in the severe environments found in military operations.  By supplying commercially available off-the-shelf hardware to Northrop Grumman in the U.S. Navy's AN/SLQ-32(V) ESE upgrade program and now in the Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) system for the new DDG-1000 ship class, MCH will have computer systems on-board more than 300 ships by the year 2012.
        </p><p>
        ESE is the first step in the Navy's Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) to address self-defense mission needs. Installing ESE in front-line ships provides a significant increase in capability now. ESE also provides the processing baseline for future SEWIP spiral development functional upgrades to further modernize and upgrade the surface Navy's electronic warfare capability.
    </p><p>
    A veteran owned small business, MCH Systems has earned a reputation of providing quality systems, rigorously tested and qualified with endless support for our customers.
</p><p>
Founder and President, C. Dale Cooke has over 30 years experience in management and engineering in the rugged military computer market.  From 1977 to 1982 Mr. Cooke was a manager at ROLM MIL-SPEC Computers, a supplier of full MIL-SPEC Computers.  In 1982 Mr. Cooke co-founded Rugged Digital Systems; the pioneering company that brought the concept of "ruggedized" commercially available computers to reality.  Through their joint marketing effort with Digital Equipment Corporation, Rugged Digital Systems ultimately brought the concept of "ruggedization" to the standard  way the military procures computer systems.  In 1997 Mr. Cooke co-founded Peripheral Equipment Corporation, also a supplier of rugged commercially available computer systems and printers.
