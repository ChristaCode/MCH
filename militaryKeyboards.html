                            <p>Designed to be a direct replacement for older ROLM MIL-SPEC Computers

                                This chassis is an eight slot VME64x system with up to four redundant 250 watt hot-swappable power supplies.   Used in naval EW and airborne signal intelligence applications this is a proven performer qualified to meet the most demanding environments.  redundant features allow full operation to continue in a degraded mode.

                                While not a fully compliant ATR chassis, this unit will directly replace any of the ROLM MIL-SPEC series of ATR computers  with side heat exchangers or can be supplied with it own ATR tray. 

                                Key Benefits

                                Our MC2000 VME chassis is an 8" high 21” deep ATR mount chassis that provides an 8 slot VME64x backplane and front panel customer specific I/O configurations. The COTS 6U VME cards are inserted into the chassis from the left or the right side with the chassis access panel removed. 
                                
                                This orientation of the VME boards allows for superior rear to front side airflow with no interference of airflow by cables exiting the I/O panel.  System configurations of up to 600 watts operating up to 55°C can be configured in this chassis.
                                
                                The MC2000 also includes a chassis health monitoring system continually monitoring the air intake temperature, the power supply baseplate temperature, fan rotation, and DC voltages. 
                                
                                Rear to front-side airflow is provided by six high performance DC fans that are demand driven based upon the temperature inside the chassis.  The fan power supply is isolated from the main power supply.
                                
                                High Availability features include a hot-swap N+1 power supply sub-system that provides up to 600 watts of usable power and a redundant fan system that will provide minimum airflow requirements during a failure condition.
                                
                                Power supply sub-system operates from 47-440 Hz and is continuous range from 90-264 and provides a 25msec holdup from drop to 0.
                                
                                Front panel indicators provide power supply, fan failure and temperature warnings.  These warnings may also be sent internally and externally to operator interfaces.
                                
                                A front panel accessible SCSI PCMCIA card reader will support your system disk or removable data requirements, 2Gb qualified at 30g operational. Additional SCSI hard disk installations are also available.

                                
                                Fully configured with CPU and I/O boards or pre-wired for your specific configuration, MCH Systems will provide a superior product and guarantee performance aboard aircraft, ships, and both tracked and wheeled ground mobile vehicles.
                                
                                This product is also available with a CompactPCI backplane that supports hot-swap capabilities.  VXS versions coming soon!</p>
